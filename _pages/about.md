# üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

I am currently a third-year master's student at Southeast University, under the supervision of Professor [Hui Xue](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/hxue/main.htm) and Associate Professor [Lei Qi](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/qilei/main.htm). My research interests include large-scale vision-language models (VLMs), computer vision, zero/few-shot learning, and anomaly detection. Prior to this, I obtained a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Wuhan University of Technology.

I have received the National Scholarship twice, in 2019 during my undergraduate studies and in 2023 during my master‚Äôs program, which is China‚Äôs highest student honor. In 2024, I was awarded the Zhishan Scholarship, Southeast University‚Äôs top prize. I also ranked first in my master‚Äôs program, 1st out of 130 students.
