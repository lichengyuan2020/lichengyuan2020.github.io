# 🧑‍💻 About Me

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Software Engineering at Southeast University, with an expected graduation in June 2025. My academic journey is supervised by Professor [Hui Xue (薛晖)](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/hxue/main.htm) and Associate Professor [Lei Qi (祁磊)](https://palm.seu.edu.cn/qilei/), both renowned experts in machine learning and computer vision.I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Wuhan University of Technology, under the guidance of Professor [Shengwu Xiong (熊盛武)](http://cst.whut.edu.cn/xygk/szdw/201505/t20150527_876901.shtml) and Professor [Congjun Rao (饶从军)](http://ssci.whut.edu.cn/szdw/zrjs/202309/t20230921_939524.shtml), both highly regarded experts in Computer Science and Mathematical Statistics.

Throughout my academic career, I have consistently excelled. I ranked 1st in my major (out of 129 students) with a GPA of 3.9/4.0, and have been awarded the prestigious National Scholarship twice (2019 and 2023). In research, I am the first author of multiple papers published in high-impact SCI journals (JCR Q1, with a cover paper), and I will present my work at ICASSP 2025 (CCF B). My research interests span several areas, including Computer Vision (e.g., large vision-language models, anomaly detection, semantic segmentation), Machine Learning (e.g., diffusion models, unsupervised learning), and Data Mining (e.g., Partial Label Learning).
