# üßë‚Äçüíª About Me

I am currently pursuing a **Master‚Äôs degree** in **Software Engineering** at **Southeast University**, expecting to graduate in **June 2025**. My studies are supervised by **Professor [Hui Xue](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/hxue/main.htm)** and **Associate Professor [Lei Qi](https://cs.seu.edu.cn/qilei/main.htm)**, both experts in machine learning and computer vision. I completed my **Bachelor‚Äôs degree** in **Computer Science and Technology** at **Wuhan University of Technology**.

I ranked **1st** in my major (out of **129 students**) with an **outstanding GPA** and have received the **National Scholarship twice** (**2019** and **2023**). As the **first author** of papers published in **SCI journals** (**JCR Q1**, **Cover paper**) and a presenter at **ICASSP 2025** (**CCF B**),, my research focuses on **AI topics**, including **visual-language models** and **anomaly detection**.

I have also earned over **10 awards** in national **mathematics and programming competitions**, including being a **finalist** (**Team Leader**, **Top 1%**) in the **U.S. Mathematical Contest in Modeling** and winning a **Silver Medal** in the **Huawei Programming Contest**. During my **9-month internship** at **ByteDance‚Äôs TikTok Department**, I applied my research to **AI projects**, enhancing my practical experience.
